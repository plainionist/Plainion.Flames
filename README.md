# Plainion.Flames: X-ray your Apps' runtime

[Plainion.Flames](http://plainionist.github.io/Plainion.Flames/) visualizes the control flow of applications based on 
[Event Tracing for Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb968803(v=vs.85).asp)
or custom traces.
Unlike other analysis tools Plainion.Flames is not limited to performance analysis - instead it encourages the understanding of 
program internals.
